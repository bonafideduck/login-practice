# Cursor Rules for Login Practice Project

## Architecture Documentation Rule

When making architectural changes to this project (including but not limited to):

- Adding new components or features
- Modifying component structure or relationships
- Changing data flow or state management
- Updating routing or navigation
- Adding new dependencies or removing existing ones
- Changing build configuration or deployment setup

**ALWAYS update the Architecture.md file** to reflect these changes. The architecture documentation should include:

- Current project structure
- Component relationships and data flow
- Key design decisions and rationale
- Technology stack and dependencies
- Deployment configuration
- Any architectural patterns or conventions used

This ensures the project documentation stays current and helps maintain consistency across development sessions.
